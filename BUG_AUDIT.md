| Severity | Area | Repro steps | Root cause guess | Proposed fix | Test to prevent regression |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | Map/Layout | `npm run lint` fails with `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` for `MapLayoutBlock` | `useSortable` was only invoked inside the `isEditing` branch, so the hook order changed between renders and eslint rejected it | Extract the draggable block into `EditableMapLayoutBlock` that always calls `useSortable` and let the non-editing branch render a plain div | `npm run lint` |
| P1 | Build | `npm run build` fails: `Cannot find module '@dnd-kit/core'` and similar | `tsconfig` uses `moduleResolution: bundler`, but the packages we import do not expose `exports` so TypeScript cannot locate their types | Add a `baseUrl`+`paths` mapping that points directly to the installed `@dnd-kit` distribution files so the bundler resolver can resolve them | `npm run build` |
| P1 | Build/Deps | `npm run build` fails: `Cannot find module 'zod'` | `adminConfigs` depends on `zod`, but it was never declared in this project's dependencies, so TypeScript cannot resolve the schema helpers | Declare `zod` in `package.json`/`package-lock` and vendor the package into `node_modules` so both statically typed code and runtime code can import it | `npm run build` |
| P1 | Map/Observability | Firestore/AppCheck failures leave the map blank with no user-facing signal and add spot submission had no breadcrumbs, so the team lacks telemetry | `listenPlaces` and `handleSpotSubmit` logged errors only to the console, so AppCheck failures or write issues were silent and provided no breadcrumbs | Add explicit log + Sentry breadcrumb helpers around the map listener and add-spot flow, surface AppCheck/Firestore errors via toast, and ensure the new QA smoke Playwright suite covers the happy path flows | `npm run test:e2e` (QA smoke suite) |
